### Steps

Note Any of Mrs. Turner’s recipes that call for cream of mushroom soup,
she probably changed to cream of chicken.

Since she won’t eat mushrooms, she doesn’t think anyone should.

So, if something sounds like it might be better with cream of mushroom,
just substitute it for cream of chicken.

Grape Salad Came from one of my Publix customers. Big hit at church
functions Ingredients 2 lb. green grapes, seedless 2lb. red grapes,
seedless (I only use red grapes - we just like it better) 8 oz. cream
cheese 8 oz. sour cream ½ c. sugar 1 c. brown sugar 1 c. finely chopped
nuts Steps Remove grapes from stems. Wash and let dry (1 or 2 dish
towels in a paper sack - shake gently - works pretty well to dry ‘em).

Bring together room temperature cream cheese and cold sour cream
together with the sugar. Will look slightly lumpy.

Mix grapes and cream cheese together. Pour into a large (9x13 pyrex)
serving dish.

Mix brown sugar and nuts together (I toast the nuts - makes it better).
Crumble over top of grapes. Best to refrigerate overnight.

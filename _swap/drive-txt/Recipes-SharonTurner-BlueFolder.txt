Note
Any of Mrs. Turner’s recipes that call for cream of mushroom soup, she probably changed to cream of chicken.


Since she won’t eat mushrooms, she doesn’t think anyone should.


So, if something sounds like it might be better with cream of mushroom, just substitute it for cream of chicken.

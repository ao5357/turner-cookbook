Summer Macaroni Salad
From Steve’s sister Rhonda
Ingredients
8 oz. Macaroni (Elbow or any kind: I used tri-color rotini, Rhonda used Bow Ties)
⅔ c. olive oil
⅓ c. red wine vinegar
¼ c. grated romano cheese
¾ T. dried basil
1 t. salt
1 t. pepper
3-4 chicken breasts, white meat, cooked and chopped
1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
4 oz. mozzarella cheese (in bite-size pieces)
4 oz. cheddar cheese (in bite-size pieces)
1 cup mayonnaise
Steps
Cook macaroni, then drain and rinse with cold water. Blend olive oil, vinegar, romano cheese, basil, salt, and pepper.

Grape Salad
Came from one of my Publix customers. Big hit at church functions
Ingredients
2 lb. green grapes, seedless
2lb. red grapes, seedless (I only use red grapes - we just like it better)
8 oz. cream cheese
8 oz. sour cream
½ c. sugar
1 c. brown sugar
1 c. finely chopped nuts
Steps
Remove grapes from stems. Wash and let dry (1 or 2 dish towels in a paper sack - shake gently - works pretty well to dry ‘em).


Bring together room temperature cream cheese and cold sour cream together with the sugar. Will look slightly lumpy.


Mix grapes and cream cheese together. Pour into a large (9x13 pyrex) serving dish.


Mix brown sugar and nuts together (I toast the nuts - makes it better). Crumble over top of grapes. Best to refrigerate overnight.

Tomato Pie
Good. From Ann, a neighbor and friend.
Ingredients
1 pie crust
4 medium tomatoes
3 strips of bacon
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1 cup mayonnaise
Steps
Bake pie crust according to instructions and allow to cool.
Cube the tomatoes and fill the crust (slightly heaping).
Crumble bacon over the tomatoes.
Mix the cheese and mayonnaise to form a thick batter. Spread over top.
Bake at 350â„‰ for 25-30 minutes, until the cheese browns.

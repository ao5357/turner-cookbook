Cheddar-Topped Homestyle Macaroni and Cheese
Close to homemade taste
Ingredients
2¼ c. hot water
1 package Deluxe Kraft Macaroni & Cheese
¼ t. ground red or black pepper
1 ½ c. shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1 c. sour cream
¼ c. crushed butter crackers
1 T. butter (melted)
Steps
Whisk hot water, cheese sauce from Kraft Deluxe package and pepper in 1 ½ to 2 Qt. Pyrex. Stir in dry pasta and 1 c. cheddar cheese.
Cover and bake at 375℉ for 30 minutes.
Uncover and stir in sour cream.


Mix rest of cheese, cracker crumbs, and melted butter. Sprinkle over top.
Bake an additional 10 minutes, uncovered.
Let stand 5 minutes.
Variations
I use more crackers and cheese over top than they call for.

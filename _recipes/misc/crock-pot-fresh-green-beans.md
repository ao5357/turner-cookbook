Crock Pot Fresh Green Beans
Delicious and tender — nicely flavored. This is my own deal. I leave the green beans whole after snapping off the ends.
Ingredients
4-6 lb. boneless pork loin
McCormick Montreal steak seasoning
2 lb. green beans
1 can chicken broth
2 packets Goya ham seasoning
Steps
Sprinkle steak seasoning on the pork loin, then saute until slightly brown.
Put green beans in crock pot. Pour just enough chicken broth to barely top the beans. Add the 2 packets of seasoning.
Place sauteed pork loin on top — single layer.
Deglaze pan and put the pork loin drippings in the crock pot.
Cook on low for 8 to 10 hours (or shorter on high).

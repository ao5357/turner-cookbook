Mrs. Robert Kennedy’s Chocolate Roll
Got this from a girl I worked with at the Vet’s office in Indiana.
Ingredients
½ t. baking powder
6 T. flour
6 T cocoa
¾ c. sugar
4 eggs
1 t. vanilla
¼ t. salt
Steps
Sift dry ingredients. Beat egg yolks with sugar.
Gently add dry ingredients, the fold in the stiffly-beaten egg whites and vanilla.
Grease a jelly roll pan then line with waxed paper. Butter and oil or grease again.
Bake at 400℉ for 1 minutes.
Turn out on wax paper that has been dusted with sugar and cocoa.
When cool, spread with whipped cream and roll up.
Keep in freezer until shortly before serving time.

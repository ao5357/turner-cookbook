Banana Pudding
This is Steve’s Mother’s recipe. Excellent.
The oatmeal cookies really set the pudding off well. We don’t buy cookies with raisins – just plain.

2 3 oz. packages vanilla instant pudding
3 c. milk
8 oz. sour cream
12 oz. frozen cool whip
12 oz. vanilla wafers or plain oatmeal cookies
6 bananas
Steps
Whisk pudding and milk.
Whisk sour cream and cool whip.
Layer:
* ½ sliced bananas
* wafers or cookies
* pudding
Repeat.

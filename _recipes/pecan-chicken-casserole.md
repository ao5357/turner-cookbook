Pecan Chicken Casserole
Ingredients
Crumb Mixture
1 c. flour
1 c. (4 oz.) finely shredded cheddar cheese
¾ c. finely chopped pecans
½ t. salt
¼ t. paprika
⅓ c. oil
Filling
4 eggs
1 c. (8 oz.) sour cream
1 c. chicken broth
4 c. diced cooked chicken
½ c. finely shredded cheddar cheese
¼ c. finely chopped onion
¼ c. mayo
¼ t. dill seed
⅛ t. hot pepper sauce
Steps
In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Set aside 1/2 cup of crumb mixture for topping. Press remaining crumb mixture onto the bottom of a greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking dish. (Crust will be crumbly.)
Bake at 350° for 10 minutes or until lightly browned.
In a large bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Pour over crust. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture.
Bake at 350° for 25-30 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.

Western Sheet Cake
From Mom Cz. Good.
Ingredients
Cake
2 sticks margarine or butter
4 T. cocoa
1 c. water
2 c. flour
2 c. sugar
1 t. salt
1 c. sour cream
2 eggs
1 t. soda
Frosting
7 T. milk
1 stick butter
4 T. cocoa (not Nestle Quik - too sweet. Use Hershey’s cocoa)
1 c. chopped nuts (optional)
1 # powdered sugar
1 t. vanilla
Steps
Cake
Bring the butter, cocoa, and water to a boil, then pour over the flour, sugar, and salt. Stir in the sour cream and soda.
Pour into a jelly roll pan (17x11)
Bake at 375℉ for 20 minutes.
Frosting
Frosting will take about 10 minutes to make, so start with 10 minutes left on the cake timer.
Boil the milk, butter, and cocoa, then add the rest of the ingredients.
Mix until smooth. Pour on cake as soon as it comes out of the oven.
Cool and chill.

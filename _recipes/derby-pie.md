Melt butter — let cool. Add sugar and vanilla. Add eggs and stir in flour. Mix well.
Add chips and walnuts.

Bake at 350℉ for 40 minutes or until golden.

#### Variations

Can substitute ½ c. sugar and ½ c. brown sugar.
Can substitute pecans for walnuts.
It is possible to make a richer pie by doubling the butter to 1 c. but not pre-melting it. Increase bake time to 1 hour.

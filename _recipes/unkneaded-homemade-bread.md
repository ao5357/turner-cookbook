Add yeast to water and stir. Then add the butter, sugar, salt, and 3 c. flour.

Beat until smooth and sticky-looking and no flour sticks to the side of the bowl.

Stir in 1-1 &frac12; c. more flour to make a soft dough.

Cover with a clean towel and let rise about 35 minutes.

Stir down and spread evenly in greased bread pans (not over half full).

Cover lightly and let rise about 40 minutes.

Bake at 350&#8457; (glass) or 375&#8457; (metal) for 45 minutes.

Bread should be lightly browned on top and make a hollow pound.

Cool on racks.

1 ½ c. great northern beans, dry
water
1-2 ham hocks
1 medium onion
¼ c. celery
1 clove garlic or 1 t. garlic powder
salt and pepper
Steps
Soak beans overnight in 1 Qt. water. Drain and measure liquid. Add water to make 2 Qts.
Simmer water, beans, and ham hocks for 2 hours.
Add rest of ingredients and simmer 1 hour.
Cut meat from the hocks and add back to the pot.
Puree 1 c. cooked beans and a little water and add back to the pot.
Season to taste.

Vidalia Onion Casserole
Good

1½ c. cheese, grated
1 can cream of chicken soup

Saute onions in butter. Place in buttered casserole. Slice eggs over onions. Sprinkle cheese over eggs.


Heat soup, milk, and mustard together until smooth. Pour over all, then crumble toast over top (I use panko w/ melted butter mixed in).

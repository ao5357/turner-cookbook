Chocolate Eclair Cake
Good. Like chocolate eclairs from the bakery. This is mine and it’s pretty.
Ingredients
Cake
2 packages (3 oz.) Jello vanilla instant pudding
3 c. milk
8 oz. Cool Whip
Graham crackers
Topping
¼ c. cocoa
¼ c. milk
2 c. powdered sugar
1 t. vanilla
Steps
Cake
Mix pudding and milk, then let sit for 5 minutes. Fold in the cool whip.
In a 13x9 dish, alternately layer whole graham crackers and pudding (starting and ending with graham crackers).
Note: Create as many layers as possible. Don’t make layers too thick.
Topping
Mix ingredients. Pour over top of cake. Refrigerate.

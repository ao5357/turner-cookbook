Poppy Seed Chicken Casserole
Got this from our 92-year-old neighbor (Miss Ruth). Very good.
Ingredients
6 chicken breasts, boneless (2-4 lb. total)
2 cans cream of chicken soup
1 pint sour cream
1½ c. “ritz” cracker crumbs
1 T. poppy seeds
½ c. butter, melted
dash salt and pepper
2 T. lemon juice
Steps
Cook and cool chicken. Cut into large pieces.
Combine cracker crumbs and butter (put ½ of crumbs in bottom of 2 Qt. pyrex). Combine chicken, soup, sour cream, poppy seeds, and lemon juice. Top with buttered crumbs.


Bake at 350℉ for 30 minutes.
Variations
 Can substitute cream of celery, cream of mushroom, or cream of chicken mushroom soup for the cream of chicken soup.


Optionally garnish with parsley and tomato.

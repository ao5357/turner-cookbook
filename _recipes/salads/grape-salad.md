Grape Salad
Came from one of my Publix customers. Big hit at church functions
Ingredients
2 lb. green grapes, seedless
2lb. red grapes, seedless (I only use red grapes - we just like it better)
8 oz. cream cheese
8 oz. sour cream
½ c. sugar
1 c. brown sugar
1 c. finely chopped nuts
Steps
Remove grapes from stems. Wash and let dry (1 or 2 dish towels in a paper sack - shake gently - works pretty well to dry ‘em).


Bring together room temperature cream cheese and cold sour cream together with the sugar. Will look slightly lumpy.


Mix grapes and cream cheese together. Pour into a large (9x13 pyrex) serving dish.


Mix brown sugar and nuts together (I toast the nuts - makes it better). Crumble over top of grapes. Best to refrigerate overnight.

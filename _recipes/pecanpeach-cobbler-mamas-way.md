Pecan-Peach Cobbler, Mama’s Way
This came from a Southern Living Magazine. DYNOMITE.
I actually halved the recipe with approximate half measurements. Was wonderful!
It’s kind of labor-intensive, but good enough to make it.
Ingredients
12  to 15 fresh peaches, peeled and sliced (about 16 cups)
⅓ c.  all-purpose flour
½ t. ground nutmeg
3 c. sugar
⅔ c. butter
1 ½ t. vanilla extract
2 (15-oz.) packages refrigerated piecrusts
½ c. chopped pecans, toasted
5 T. sugar, divided
Sweetened whipped cream
Steps
1. Preheat oven to 475°. Stir together peaches, flour, nutmeg, and 3 cups sugar in a Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to low, and simmer 10 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in butter and vanilla. Spoon half of mixture into a lightly greased 13- x 9-inch baking dish.
2. Unroll 2 piecrusts. Sprinkle 1/4 cup pecans and 2 Tbsp. sugar over 1 piecrust; top with other piecrust. Roll to a 14- x 10-inch rectangle. Trim sides to fit baking dish. Place pastry over peach mixture in dish.
3. Bake at 475° for 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly browned. Unroll remaining 2 piecrusts. Sprinkle 2 Tbsp. sugar and remaining 1/4 cup pecans over 1 piecrust; top with remaining piecrust. Roll into a 12-inch circle. Cut into 1-inch strips, using a fluted pastry wheel. Spoon remaining peach mixture over baked pastry. Arrange pastry strips over peach mixture; sprinkle with remaining 1 Tbsp. sugar. Bake 15 to 18 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm or cold with whipped cream.

Walter’s Cookies
I don’t really like to make roll out cookies but these are excellent.
Walter is the chef at the Italian Farm when I first came down to Georgia.
Ingredients
2 c. sugar
1 lb. butter
6 hard-boiled egg yolks
2 t. vanilla
1 lemon peel
pinch powdered ammonia (alum)
4 c. flour
Steps
Gently mix together the cream (sugar and butter) and the egg yolk paste.
Add the rest of the ingredients, but don’t work them too much.
Let rest for 40 minutes before use.
Roll out and use cookie cutter.
Bake at 350℉ for 10 minutes.
